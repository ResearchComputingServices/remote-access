To be able to participate in this lesson you will need to install some software to be able to connect the the RCDC. 


### Connecting to Carleton's VPN

To be able to connect to the RCDC from your laptop (using wifi) or from outside of campus, you will need to connect to Carleton's VPN. Full instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/remote-access/). 


### Preparing your computer to connect to the RCDC

Depending on the operating system on your computer you will have to do certain things to be able to fully participate in the lesson. Please follow the instructions that pertain to you.


#### Windows 10 Users

To be able to participate in this lesson we will need you to install some software to give you access to a command shell. MobaXTerm is a powerful terminal program for Windows. It allows you to use Linux commands on a Windows PC, to remotely connect your RCDC Virtual Machine (VM), transfer files, and even to remotely run graphical programs on your VM. The free Home Edition of MobaXterm can be found [here](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).

Once you have installed MobaXTerm, run the program. In the top left corner click Sesson and then click the big button in the middle that reads "Start local terminal". Once you have gotten to this point you are ready to participate in the lesson.

#### Mac Users

To be able to run programs using Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), you will need to have X11 installed on your Mac. Information about this, including instructions to download and install it, can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201341). 

Once you have installed X11, you will need to open a terminal window. To do this, navigate to Applications/Utilities and open Terminal. Once you have reached this stage you are ready to participate in the lesson. 

#### Linux Users

To be able to participate in this lesson we will only need you to open a terminal window. If you do not know how to do this, either email your instructor before the lesson starts or ask when you arrive.
